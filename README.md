# Hackathon---Loan-default-classification
### Identify if a borrower would default(or not) based on given features

## This is a supervised binary classification problem with an imbalanced dataset.
### Best training and testing prediction accuracy(F1) is found using ExtraTrees Classifier.

## Instructions to execute the notebook:

1. Ensure that both the Notebook(.ipnyb file) and the ProcessClass.py helper class file are located in the same folder
2. Ensure that all input data file(training, testing etc.) are also placed in the same folder as the main notebook
3. All python packages used in the notebook are being imported in the very first code block. If any package is missing, please install the same using conda install or pip install as applicable
4. All the code cells can be run at once in sequence using Run All option. Ensure to monitor the cells to see if all them complete in the right order. There is a number at the extreme left which should be in increasing order 
5. Final prediction file is written out to the same location as original notebook
